While being a native of Wetzel County, he later migrated to Tyler County. Before he decided to help people with his hands, he worked on the railroad. He was in this line of work for several years before his eyesight prevented him from continuing further. Deciding to focus on his hands rather than his eyesight, Matt enrolled in the CBA School of Massage Therapy located in Clarksburg, WV. He graduated in the top of his class and for the last three years he has been a practitioner in Middlebourne in tyler county. </p>
 <p>
While massage is usually thoughts of for pampering and luxury, that is not always the case. While it can be used for those purposes, massage and bodywork has been proven to have many healing properties. While it CAN be explained, nothing is better than experiencing it for yourself. So come on in and feel for yourself at 4 Senses Massage and Bodywork, where feeling is believing.

4 Senses Massage offers full body Swedish, chair, integrative stretching, pregnancy, and deep tissue massage.  Other modalities are available upon request.  All these can aid in increasing circulation, detoxifying waste material from muscles, improving muscle tone, flexibility, and range of motion, decrease symptoms of pain, depression, anxiety and impart a feeling of well-being. Any and all of these therapies can also cause increased tenderness and even pain to affected areas.  An increase in circulation can be harmful to some clients with certain fluid imbalances such as severe edema, CHF, high blood pressure and kidney problems.  Please alert your therapist if you have any of these or any other serious conditions.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Sessions are scheduled by appointment only.  If a client is greater than 15 minutes late to an appointment, they WILL be asked to reschedule.   If a client habitually misses or arrives late for their appointments, the therapist may refuse to schedule that client again.  The length of sessions are to be determined by the client and therapist at the time the appointment is made and no extra time will be afforded.  All information shared in preparation for, during, and immediately after a session shall be kept confidential unless subpoenaed by a court of law or in an emergency situation.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Fees for services are; full body Swedish $45, deep tissue $45, chair $15, hands and feet only $30, integrative stretching $45, and hot stone $65.  Cash and checks are accepted.  If 4 Senses receives a returned check, the therapist will only accept cash from that client from that point on.
</li>
<br>
<li>
At your appointment, you will complete the intake form and discuss the session with your therapist.  The therapist will then instruct you on how to prepare for the massage and will leave the room while you disrobe.  Music, aroma, and reduced lighting are part of the massage experience but any client can request to eliminate any of those things to be changed to make the session more comfortable.  You may be encouraged to continue stretches learned in your sessions but consult your doctor before doing any strenuous exercise or if you have pain or numbness as this may be a sign of a serious health issue.

   <p> <strong>Swedish</strong> - the most commonly used form of classical Western massage, generally performed in the direction of the heart, sometimes with active or passive movement of the joints. It is used especially for relaxation, relief of muscular tension, and improvement of circulation and range of motion.<br></p>
    <Br>

<p><strong>Deep tissue</strong> - A type of massage in which the fingers, thumbs and elbows are used to release chronic muscle tension, using slow, deep strokes and friction and is designed to access multiple layers of muscle and fascia to improve alignment, reduce levels of resting tension, and create more efficient postural and movement patterns. </p><Br>

<p><strong>Prenatal</strong> -  It aims to relax tense muscles, ease sore spots, improve circulation and mobility, and just make you feel good. But prenatal massage is also customized to the needs of pregnant women and their changing bodies. </p>
<Br>
<p><strong>Chair</strong> - Chair massage is a style of seated massage that is typically short -- 10 or 15 minutes -- and focuses on your back, shoulders and neck and arms. Chair massage is done over clothes and doesn't require any massage oil. </p><Br>

<p><strong>Hands and Feet</strong> -  A 30 minute massage focusing only on the forearms and hands, and lower legs and feet only. Helps with carpal tunnel and, wrist and ankle mobility. </p><Br>

<p><strong>Hot Stone</strong> - Hot stone massage is a specialty massage where the therapist uses smooth, heated stones as an extension of their own hands, or by placing them on the body. The heat can be both deeply relaxing and help warm up tight muscles so the therapist can work more deeply, more quickly. </p>
<Br>
<p><strong>Integrated Stretching</strong> - a full body stretch, where the client is fully clothed and no oil is used. The therapist uses stretching techniques that will help with stiffness, mobility, range of motion, and circulation. </p>

   <p>I called 4 Senses Massage last week to get an appointment. Matt was able to accommodate the date and time I requested. He was waiting for me and was very professional. I can give him no less than an A+ and I will definitely be a repeat customer.</p>

     The massage I received from Matt was better than the one I received while on vacation at a Sandals resort. Red Lane Spa at Sandals boasts "world class service." That should tell you something about Matt's skills, because he definitely out performed that masseuse.

           <p>I was Matt's first client of the day. 
The experience was professionally and pleasantly done. Matt is thorough and attentive. It seems like this is his calling: he was made for this profession. Anyone who puts themselves in Matt's hands will be on the road to wellness! I plan to be a repeat client and am recommending 4 Senses to you.

     Just finished my second session with Matt -- he worked out some knots in my back and shoulders that had been bothering me for weeks! I'll definitely be booking another appointment the next time I'm in town. The space is really comfortable and relaxing,and Matt's approach is really well-suited to people who might be hesitant to try massage for the first time. Middlebourne is really lucky to have a place like this at such a reasonable price!
